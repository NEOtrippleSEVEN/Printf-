Printf() is a cariadic function, so it can accept mutliple arguments at once after the formatted string.

** The "f" in printf() stand for: formatted string **

How would our function ACTUALLY output the characters??
	- Printf() relies on a fundemental system call.

	1. We can use the "Write" function to help us output single/multipole char in a string. 
	2. 



ARGUMENTS 	--> When you call a function the arguments are placed in memory (the stack)..
				We don't know how many arguments there are, we need to walk through memory
				one step at a time, picking them up.

<stdarg.h> Library is used for this type of task. (va_something --> variable argument)

--> 	va_list:	Special variable type (int or char) that acts like you cursor/iterator. 
					Declaring a variable of this type tracks your position in the argument list. 

		va_start:	This macro inisialises your cursor/iterator (where to start). 
					In C, it start right at the last known location, in my case it is the 
					format string (const char *).
		
		va_arg:		This retrieves the actual value. You have to tell it what type of data it
					expects to find there so it knwos how much memory to read. (char)va_arg(args, int);
		
		va_end:		Cleans up memory when you are done. 


<	For Example	>

int main()
{
	declare va_list(args) then intialise It using va_start. 
	va_start takes two inputs. lst var and last known
}


You have to implement the following conversions:
• %c Prints a single character.
• %s Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
• %p The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.
• %d Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
• %i Prints an integer in base 10.
• %u Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
• %x Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
• %X Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.
• %% Prints a percent sign.
